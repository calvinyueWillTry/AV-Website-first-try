# AV-Website-first-try
For this website, I started with establishing the layout, so having 4 sections. After the header, I set up the section, each with their own link in the navigation bar.

Then I wrote the bio, and uploaded some photos in specific dimensions, as well as a row for the upright ones, as part of the requirements.

I also added a sample of works section. However, the audio files couldn't upload to GitHub, so I removed those, and the section if currently empty. It had audio sourced from file, and a control to allow start, pause, and move forward/backward. I also fitte them to make sure that they had flex row, and fitted together. Here is what it would have looked like:

And here are the codes that I used to create those in the first place:

Then for the footer, I created a contact section to allow contact in the future, including their contact information to respond back via email.

Decoratively, I added font-size, font-weight, text-shadow, borders, border radius, and different background colors.
This was my first attempt at building a website.
